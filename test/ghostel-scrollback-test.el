Regression test for issue #127: in TUIs whose cursor sits above the
viewport bottom, opening the minibuffer shrinks the window body and
Emacs's `keep-point-visible' moves `window-start' forward so the TUI
cursor stays on screen.  The resulting `ws < anchor' looked identical
to a real user scroll, so the force redraw captured a blank-row key,
found it at `point-min', and jumped `window-start' to 1.

With the fix, a force redraw classifies a window as anchored when it

so an Emacs-driven drift is treated as drift, not a scroll."
